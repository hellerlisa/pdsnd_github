### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I did also write a code that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

*Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
*A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)
*A terminal application

### An Interactive Experience
The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change!

### The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

*Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
*End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
*Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
*Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
*End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
*User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

*Gender
*Birth Year

### Statistics Computed
You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

*most common month
*most common day of week
*most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

*most common start station
*most common end station
*most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

*total travel time
*average travel time

#4 User info

*counts of each user type
*counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
*earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
To answer these questions using Python, I needed to write a Python script. To help guide my work in this project, a template with helper code and comments was provided in a bikeshare.py file, and I did my scripting in there. I needed the three city dataset files too:

*bikeshare_2.py
*chicago.csv
*new_york_city.csv
*washington.csv
